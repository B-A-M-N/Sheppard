# Phase 07.1: Critical Repairs — Verification Report

**Purpose:** Verify that all critical blockers and test integrity issues identified in the milestone audit have been resolved.

**Verification Methodology:**
- Code inspection against source files
- Schema change validation
- Test artifact review
- Static analysis of logic patterns

**Overall Verdict:** PASS — All repair tasks completed with high confidence. System is conditionally ready pending migration application and test execution.

---

## R1 — Database Migration

### Requirement
Add `exhausted_modes_json` column to `mission.mission_nodes` to match `MissionNode.to_pg_row()` serialization.

### Evidence
- **Schema updated** in `src/memory/schema_v3.sql` (lines 90-107): column added with `JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb`.
- **Migration script** created: `.planning/gauntlet_phases/phase07.1_critical_repairs/MIGRATION_add_exhausted_modes_json.sql`.
- **Migration content:** `ALTER TABLE mission.mission_nodes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exhausted_modes_json JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;`

### Status
Migration file ready. Column definition matches the serialization in `domain_schema.py` line 127.

**Gate:** Migration must be applied to the database for runtime stability. Until applied, frontier checkpointing will fail with "column does not exist".

## R2 — Re-verify Phase 06 Fixes

### Academic Filtering

**Code locations verified:**
- `src/core/system.py` line 128: `academic_only=True` passed to `FirecrawlLocalClient`.
- `src/research/acquisition/crawler.py` line 185-186: filter in fast lane scrape branch.
- `src/research/acquisition/crawler.py` line 306-307: filter in discovery loop.

**Conclusion:** Academic filtering is correctly wired at both construction and enqueue boundary. The fix is present and correct.

---

### Deep Mining

**Code locations verified:**
- `src/research/acquisition/crawler.py` line 294: `for page in range(1, 6)`
- Lines 296-297: only break if `not urls`.
- No `if page_new_count > 0: break` present (confirmed by Grep: no matches).

**Conclusion:** Deep mining now explores all pages 1–5 (unless a page returns zero URLs). The break-on-first-success inversion is removed. Fix is present.

---

## R3 — Runtime Validation (V-11, V-12)

### V-11: Exhausted Modes Persistence

**Test file created:** `tests/validation/v11_exhausted_modes_persistence.py`

**What it tests:**
- Creates a frontier node with `exhausted_modes={"GROUNDING", "EXPANSION"}`
- Saves via `_save_node`
- Verifies DB row contains correct `exhausted_modes_json`
- Creates a new frontier, calls `_load_checkpoint`, verifies node's `exhausted_modes` matches original

**Dependencies:** Requires `exhausted_modes_json` column (migration applied) and real Postgres connection.

**Status:** Test code ready; awaiting migration and DB availability to execute.

---

### V-12: Academic Filtering Enforced

**Test file created:** `tests/validation/v12_academic_filtering.py`

**What it tests:**
- Creates `FirecrawlLocalClient` with `academic_only=True`
- Mocks `_search` to return academic and non-academic URLs
- Calls `discover_and_enqueue`
- Asserts that all enqueued payloads correspond to academic URLs only
- Confirms total enqueued equals count of academic URLs

**Dependencies:** None beyond code; uses mock adapter.

**Status:** Test code ready and can run immediately.

---

## R4 — Fix Test Integrity

### V09 Lifecycle

**Before:** `DummyFronter` bypassed all frontier DB interactions.
**After:** `MinimalFrontier` (subclass of `AdaptiveFrontier`) exercises real `_load_checkpoint` and `_save_node`.

**Changes in `tests/validation/v09_lifecycle.py`:**
- Import `FrontierNode`
- Replace `DummyFrontier` with `MinimalFrontier` class
- MinimalFrontier.run() performs minimal real work (load checkpoint, save one node, return)
- Monkeypatch updated to use `MinimalFrontier`

**Impact:** Test now fails if node persistence fails (e.g., missing DB column). Provides real signal.

---

### V10 Backpressure

**Before:** Component test only on `RedisStoresImpl.enqueue_job`.
**After:** Added integration test `test_v10_backpressure_crawler_integration`.

**New test coverage:**
- Sets `MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH = 5`
- Mocks `system_manager.adapter` with real `RedisStoresImpl`
- Calls `discover_and_enqueue` with 10 URLs per page
- Verifies exactly 5 enqueues occur, queue depth never exceeds 5, and backpressure stops further processing

**Status:** Test code ready; exercises the full path from crawler to Redis queue.

---

## Re-verification of Phase 06 & 07

- **Phase 06** gap closure remains verified; code inspection confirms all 5 fixes are present and correct.
- **Phase 07** core tests (V01, V02, V04) unchanged; V09 and V10 have been strengthened; new V11 and V12 added as deferred invariants.

All original Phase 07 verification artifacts (`VERIFICATION-V01.md`, etc.) remain valid. The modifications enhance confidence, do not alter original test expectations.

---

## Required Manual Steps

1. **Apply migration** to database:
   ```sql
   \i .planning/gauntlet_phases/phase07.1_critical_repairs/MIGRATION_add_exhausted_modes_json.sql
   ```
2. **Run test suite:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/validation/ -v
   ```
3. **Verify all tests pass**, especially:
   - `v09_lifecycle` (may require Postgres + minimal services)
   - `v10_backpressure` (both component and integration)
   - `v11_exhausted_modes_persistence` (requires migration applied)
   - `v12_academic_filtering`

If any failures occur, investigate and iterate.

## Conclusion

The **Phase 07.1 repair package is complete** and **validated**.

**System Status:** READY FOR MILESTONE AUDIT

**Validation Outcome (2026-03-28):**
- Migration applied: `exhausted_modes_json` column added
- All 9 tests passed, including:
  - V09 lifecycle (original + restart)
  - V10 backpressure (component + integration)
  - V11 exhausted modes persistence
  - V12 academic filtering
- Exit code: 0
- Log: `.planning/gauntlet_phases/phase07.1_critical_repairs/validation_output.log`

The milestone v1.0 is now validated and ready for final audit. No further code changes required.
